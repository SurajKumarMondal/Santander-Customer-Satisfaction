# Santander-Customer-Satisfaction

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.
In this project, we have worked with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.
We had been provided with a dataset containing many numeric variables. The "TARGET" column is the variable to predict. It equals 1 for unsatisfied customers and 0 for satisfied customers.
The task is to predict the probability of each customer in the test set being unsatisfied.
